## How to Use

### Create a character from scratch

1. Open the app and pick a game variant (D&D 5e, Brancalonia, or Apocalisse)
2. Click **"From Scratch"** under the variant card
3. Follow the 9-step wizard: choose race, class, generate ability scores, pick background, equipment, spells, fill in details
4. On the review page, export as **PDF** (editable fields) or **JSON**

### Generate a random character

Click **"Random"** under any variant card to instantly create a fully built character. You'll land on the review page where you can tweak, save, or export.

### Import a character from JSON

1. Click **"Import JSON"** under the variant you're importing for
2. Select a `.json` file previously exported from this app
3. The file is validated — if anything is wrong, you'll see specific error messages
4. If the character belongs to a different variant, you'll be warned but it will still load

### Export to PDF

From the review page, click **"Export PDF Sheet"**. The exported PDF uses the official character sheet with **editable AcroForm fields** — you can keep filling it in with any PDF reader (Adobe Acrobat, Foxit, etc.).

### Save characters

Click **"Save Character"** on the review page. Characters are stored in your browser's localStorage and appear on the home page for quick access.
